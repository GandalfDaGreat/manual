* Automatically generate code from a single source, so the manuscript and each
  code folder won't ever get out of date. Each code snippet should get
  automatically placed into the correct locations according to templates. There
  should only be one definitive source for each code snippet.
* Color the sprite_tile_layout program listing like we used to before moving to
  DocBook.
* Explain more about the benefits of using OOP on DS and how this doesn't mean
  only code in C++.
* Explain fixed point numbers better.
* Rearrange the include files, so that our own header files come before system
  ones.
* Explain caching better, to provide context around the functions like
  DC_FlushAll and DC_FlushRange, hopefully making them more understandable.
