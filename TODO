* Remove dependence on svn in Makefiles and shell scripts
* Add an infinite loop in main to prevent falling off into reset
* Update names of SpriteEntry fields
* Update touchRead in the manuscript
* Automatically generate code from a single source, so the manuscript and each
  code folder won't ever get out of date. Each code snippet should get
  automatically placed into the correct locations according to templates. There
  should only be one definitive source for each code snippet.
